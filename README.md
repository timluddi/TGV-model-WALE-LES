The first two folders contain the energy and the dissipation over time per grid size and whether WALE has been used. The third one contains the energy spectra for various time steps, grid sizes and WALE/non-WALE usage. Lastly, the code simulates the Taylor-Green vortex based on various parameters. 
The code is self-contained and explains everything when downloaded as an .ipynb file.
