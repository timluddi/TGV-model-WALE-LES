There are five folders. The first 4 contain .dat files that have been used to make the plots. The folders each contain the energy over time, the dissipation over time, the energy decay file per timestep and the reference solution from the NASA paper on the Taylor-Green vortex. These folders contain the .dat files for all "LES flags" and all grid sizes used in the project. The last folder contains the code in an .ipynb and a .py file. The .ipynb file is specifically there to explain every cell and give an example per code ran. The .py file is the raw code file.
